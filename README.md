# Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV) for Material Handling

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the design, construction, and deployment of an Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV) aimed at improving material handling processes. The AGV is equipped with sensors and actuators for autonomous navigation and object manipulation within a predefined environment. Powered by an Arduino UNO R3, it seeks to increase efficiency and reduce human intervention in material transport tasks.

## Purpose
The AGV project aims to automate material transportation, reducing manual labor and minimizing errors. It aligns with the growing adoption of smart automation technologies in operational processes.

## Key Features
- **Autonomous Navigation**: Utilizes sensors like HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor and LM393 Infrared Sensors to detect obstacles and follow a path.
- **Material Handling**: Equipped with a forklift mechanism for object manipulation.
- **Efficient Power Management**: Optimized for power consumption to maintain operational efficiency.

## Components
- **Arduino UNO R3 Board**: The central control unit for processing instructions and managing communication with sensors and actuators.
- **HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor**: Enables obstacle detection by measuring distance.
- **LM393 Infrared Sensors**: Used for line-following or edge detection.
- **L293D Motor Driver Shield**: Controls the movement of the DC motors.
- **Dual Shaft Geared TT Motors**: Provides movement and traction for the AGV.
- **Servo Motor SG90**: Controls the forklift mechanism for object manipulation.
- **Linear Micro Servo Motor Actuator FS90**: Provides linear movement for precise adjustments.

## System Architecture
The AGV is designed to autonomously navigate through an environment, detect and avoid obstacles, and manipulate objects using a forklift mechanism. It performs these tasks using data from its sensors and pre-defined instructions, enabling it to operate with minimal human intervention.
